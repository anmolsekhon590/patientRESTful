# PatientRESTful

PatientRESTful is a restful web service that allows us to do CRUD operations on a Patient Database via REST API.

## Test the API:
It is currently hosted on [Heroku](http://patientrestful.herokuapp.com/patient).
Please note that the changes you'll make will not persist. Since, the service is using in-memory database for testing purposes
